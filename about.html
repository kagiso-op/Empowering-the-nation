  <!-- Who We Are Section -->
  <section class="about">
    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      Empowering the Nation is an initiative founded by Precious Radebe in 2022 to provide skills training for domestic workers and gardeners in Johannesburg. Our aim is to help members of the community gain new skills, improve their employability, and increase their earning potential.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of the people we serve never had the chance to pursue formal education or upskill themselves. Through our programs, they gain valuable life and professional skills that enable them to either grow within existing jobs or start their own small businesses.

  <!-- Short History Section -->
  <section class="about">
    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>
      Since our establishment in 2022, hundreds of domestic workers and gardeners have successfully completed either our six-month Learnerships or six-week Short Skills Training Programmes. Graduates leave equipped with new skills that make them more marketable and capable of earning higher wages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our courses are designed not only to teach technical skills like first aid, sewing, landscaping, cooking, and child care, but also life skills that help participants navigate daily challenges and achieve long-term success.
